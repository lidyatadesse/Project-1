## Part 1: Explore the Data
1. How many songs are in each genre? <br/>

|                 pop = 5507 
|                 r&b = 5431 
|                 rap = 5746 
|                 rock = 4951 

<br/>

2. What is average value of energy and acousticness in the latin genre in this dataset? <br/>

|                 mean energy = 0.7083125
|                 mean acousticness = 0.2109204  


<br/>

3. Calculate the average duration of song (in minutes) across all subgenres. Which subgenre has the longest song on average? <br/>


|                 New Jack Swing is the subgenre with the longest songs. On average, they are 275128.6 ms in length.

4. Make two boxplots side-by-side of the danceability of songs stratifying by whether a song has a fast or slow tempo. Define fast tempo as any song that has a tempo above its median value. On average, which songs are more danceable?


|               Median tempo is 121.98.
